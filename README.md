# banking-parallel
A high-performance banking system that validates, logs, and processes transactions with multi-threading for concurrency and Spring Batch for bulk processing. It ensures high throughput, real-time fraud detection, and secure transaction handling while maintaining scalability and efficiency.


ðŸ“Œ Project: Real-time Transaction Processing System
ðŸ’¡ Idea
A high-performance banking system that processes financial transactions in real-time while ensuring data accuracy and security.
The system validates transactions, processes payments, and logs them efficiently using multi-threading.
Spring Batch is used to periodically aggregate transactions, generate reports, and detect fraud.
ðŸ›  Implementation Steps
â¿¡ Setting Up the Environment & Technologies
ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used:

Spring Boot (Backend API)
Spring Batch (Batch Processing)
Multi-threading (ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, ThreadPoolExecutor)
PostgreSQL / MySQL (Database)
Kafka / RabbitMQ (Optional for messaging and high throughput)
â¿¢ Multi-threaded Real-time Transaction Handling
ðŸ’¡ Here, Multi-threading is used to process multiple transactions concurrently.

ðŸ”¹ Scenario:

Users initiate transactions via REST API (money transfers, deposits, withdrawals).
Instead of processing transactions sequentially (which is slow), the system distributes them across multiple threads for parallel processing.
âœ… Implementation:

Use Thread Pool (ExecutorService) to handle multiple transactions in parallel.
Each transaction is validated asynchronously using CompletableFuture.supplyAsync().
Transactions are stored in the database immediately after processing.
Concurrency Control is implemented using optimistic locking to avoid conflicts.
â¿£ Batch Processing for Reporting & Fraud Detection
ðŸ’¡ Here, Spring Batch is used to analyze stored transactions in bulk.

ðŸ”¹ Scenario:

Periodically, the system aggregates all transactions from the last hour/day/week for:
Generating financial reports for customers and bank administrators.
Detecting fraudulent activities (e.g., detecting suspicious transactions).
Optimizing database performance by archiving old transaction data.
âœ… Implementation:

Define a Spring Batch Job with Reader â†’ Processor â†’ Writer structure:
ItemReader: Reads recent transactions from the database.
ItemProcessor: Checks for suspicious activity (e.g., high-volume transactions).
ItemWriter: Logs findings in a fraud detection table and generates reports.
Use Chunk Processing (e.g., batch size of 1000 records) to avoid overloading the database.
Schedule the batch job to run every hour using Spring Scheduler (@Scheduled).
â¿¤ Optimizing Performance with Kafka or RabbitMQ (Optional)
ðŸ’¡ To improve scalability, a message queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ) can be used to handle transaction events asynchronously.

âœ… Implementation:

Instead of storing transactions immediately in the database, they are sent to a Kafka topic.
A Kafka consumer service processes the transactions asynchronously, reducing API response time.
â¿¥ Performance Testing & Optimization
ðŸ’¡ We use JMeter or Gatling to test system performance under high load.

âœ… Optimization Techniques:

Thread Pool Tuning: Adjust the number of threads based on CPU cores.
Database Indexing: Speed up queries on transaction data.
Batch Size Optimization: Choose an appropriate chunk size for batch processing.
ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes
âœ… Fast and scalable transaction processing with multi-threading.
âœ… Efficient batch processing for fraud detection and reporting.
âœ… High system throughput with reducedÂ latency.
